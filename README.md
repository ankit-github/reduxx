### Similar to SpaceX and iPhoneX, ReduxX is the **next generation** React state management tool.

**(with 100% code coverageüòâüëçüèøüëçüèΩüëçüèª)**

#### ReduxX is a lightweight yet super-powerful, very easy to learn, and very easy to set up React state management library.

#### **ReduxX News:**

## [Please use ReduxX version 2.0.4](https://github.com/msteckyefantis/reduxx/tree/6f4bfccb928b14fffdd35d92e357a9ed77850b2d),

 ReduxX is currently going through experimental development and version 5 has some issues that need to be resolved and it is not guaranteed to work, version 2.0.4 should work fine.

## Why Use ReduxX:

In larger React apps, it's really nice to have global state (global as in globally accessible, **NOT** stored as a global browser variable). But when normally dealing with a global state object, you may encounter a problem, your state may look something like this:

```
...
accountSettingsEmailVerified: true
user: 'dandan69'
userProfileFirstName: 'Danny'
userProfileMainPicture: null
userProfileMainPictureIsPublic: true
...
```

And when getting and setting the global state, it looks something like this:

```.js
// the old way: getting value from the global state
const mainPicture = (

    globalStateStorageInstance.state.userProfileMainPicture
);

// the old way: setting a value in the global state
globalStateStorageInstance.setState({

    userProfileMainPicture: 'https://image.png'
});
```

Alternatively, you can use nested React state to have nicer variable names to deal with. The problem with that is it gets unnecessarily confusing and messy looking:

```.js
/*
  the old way: updating a nested component

    in this example, assume the state key "pictures"
    has an associated value which is an
    object with several properties


    Below is how you would update
    a single property of the pictures object
    while preserving the other properties
*/
globalStateComponent.setState( previousState => {

    return {

        pictures: Object.assign(

            {},

            previousState.pictures,

            {
                mainPicture: 'https://image.png'
            }
        )
    };
});
```

üôàEwww, that's not very nice.üò∞

#### Don't fear, ReduxX is here to save the day!üêâüê¨üêô

with ReduxX, the same state as above is automatically generated and it will look something like this:

```
...
accountSettings-EmailVerified: true
user: 'dandan69',
user-profile-firstName: 'Danny'
user-profile-mainPicture: null
user-profile-mainPicture-isPublic: true
...
```
and to get and set the state, you just need to do this:


```.js
// cleanly get a global state value with ReduxX:

const mainPicture = reduxX.getState({

    key1: 'user',
    key2: 'profile',
    key3: 'mainPicture'
});

// smoothly set a global state value with ReduxX:

reduxX.setState({

    key1: 'user',
    key2: 'profile',
    key3: 'mainPicture',
    value: 'https://image.png'
});


// Note: you can use any number of keys
// to set and get values from the global state
```


#### Why is ReduxX better than the other old fashioned React state management libraries?

**ReduxX is incredibly simple** to install and learn. Everything you need to know is contained in this README.md file. **For ReduxX you only need to follow the 3 simple steps in the [How ReduxX Works Section](#how-reduxx-works) below!** Essentially, you only need to be concerned with two functions: `reduxX.getState`, and `reduxX.setState`. These functions work exactly like normal React state, except you can use them anywhere in your code to access a global state, wow!

---


## How ReduxX works:


### Step 1: Install ReduxX and Set Your Initial Global State

To install ReduxX, input the following npm command:
```
npm install reduxx --save
```

In the directory of your main React component, the most parent component that contains all your other components, add the following `reduxx.js` file:

```.js
'use strict';

const ReduxX = require( 'reduxx' );


module.exports = ReduxX({

    initialState: [

        {
            key1: 'monkey',
            key2: 'favoriteFood',
            value: 'banana',
        },
        {
            key1: 'monkey',
            value: 'curious george',
        },
        {
            key1: 'monkey',
            key2: 'height',
            value: '69cm',
        },
        {
            key1: 'hippo',
            key2: 'status',
            key3: 'mood',
            value: 'hungry',
        }
    ]    
});
```
> Notes:
>
> a) ReduxX assumes React is installed
>
> b) you can use any number of keys
>
> c) technically you can put this reduxx.js file anywhere, but it makes the most sense to put it in your root folder based on how you access it (in Step 3)
>
>

### Step 2: Set up ReduxX

In the most parent component itself, the component that contains all your other components, create a React element using the `ReduxXStateStorageComponent` and this will be a wrapper component for your other components:

```.js
'use strict';

const React = require( 'react' );

/*
 Note: you don't actually have to put components
 like the following two here. They are placeholders.
 This is just to show how the ReduxXStateStorageComponent
 might fit in with your other code.
*/
const YourOtherComponent = require( '...' );
const AnotherOneOfYourComponents = require( '...' );

// import the following component from the file you created in Step 1
// (Note: this particular path below assumes the reduxx.js file
// is in the same directory as this file)
const { ReduxXStateStorageComponent } = require( './reduxx.js' );


// Your "most parent" component
module.exports = class App extends React.Component {

    render() {

        return (

            // Step 2) create the required
            //        ReduxX React element
            //                  like this:
            <ReduxXStateStorageComponent>

                <YourOtherComponent/> // placeholder elements
                <AnotherOneOfYourComponents/>

            </ReduxXStateStorageComponent>
        )
    }
}
```


### Step 3: Easily Get and Set Values to the Global State

Now anywhere you normally do a React [setState](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#setstate), you can now setState with ReduxX to access a global state and never have to worry about collisions, so exciting!:

```.js
'use strict';

// some other module

const React = require( 'react' );

const reduxX = require( /*path to reduxx.js file, the file created in Step 1*/ );


function handleClick() {

    /*
       ReduxX Effortless State Setting and Getting
    */

    // set the global state for one or more items like this:

    reduxX.setState(

        {
            key1: 'monkey',
            key2: 'favoriteFood',
            value: 'apple',
        },
        {
            key1: 'hippo',
            key2: 'status',
            key3: 'mood',
            value: 'full',
        }
    );

    // get the global state for an item like this:

    const monkeyHeight = reduxX.getState({

        key1: 'monkey',
        key2: 'height'
    });

    console.log(

        `The reduxX monkey is ${ monkeyHeight } tall!`
    );

    // should log: The reduxX monkey is 69cm tall!
}


module.exports = class SomeDiv extends React.Component {

    render() {

        return <div onClick={this.handleClick} />;
    }
}
```
This example also includes a `reduxX.getState` invocation. You can use this function anywhere and this function gets the requested value from the global state! Extreme #swaggyüê∏üéÖüèøüë≥üèΩüêâ!

<br/><br/>


Wow that's it, <b>so easy!</b>

All you need to do is require your `./reduxx.js` file you created in Step 1 and then use `reduxX.setState` and `reduxX.getState` to manage your global state (like in Step 3).

## Bonus Features

### Obscure Your State Keys

Recalling our state from before:

```
...
accountSettings-EmailVerified: true
user: 'dandan69'
user-profile-firstName: 'Danny'
user-profile-mainPicture: null
user-profile-mainPicture-isPublic: true
...
```

You can obscure your state keys by automatically turning them into GUIDs so that your state will look something like this:

```
...
206ca40e-e643-17b6-da3c-616b90800f4e: true
335a8849-9bff-bd2c-9a1a-6f26d61e0f88: 'dandan69'
ae771d1a-f563-c876-3132-b958e62ca205: 'Danny'
1721716f-4d92-ea42-56ca-5df95c175413: null
e04659d7-38a6-bae8-b513-36cfcb300ba7: true
...
```
To obscure your keys, simply set up your ReduxX ([Step 1](#step-1-install-reduxx-and-set-your-initial-global-state)), like this:

```.js
'use strict';

const ReduxX = require( 'reduxx' );


module.exports = ReduxX({

    // adding this will obscure your state keys
    obscureStateKeys: true,

    initialState: [

        ... // the same initial state objects go here
    ],    
});
```


### Old Fashioned State Managment

You can also access and alter the global state manually.
The globalStateStorageInstance (and its state)
is just a normal React Component instance (and state).

```.js
'use strict';

// some other module

const React = require( 'react' );

const reduxX = require( /*path to reduxx.js file, the file created in Step 1*/ );


function handleClick() {

    /*
       Old Fashioned State Setting and Getting:
    */

    const { globalStateStorageInstance } = reduxX;

    // You can get and set regular state keys
    // in the global state storage component instance:

    globalStateStorageInstance.setState({

        hello: 'world'
    });

    setTimeout( () => {

        const world = globalStateStorageInstance.state.hello;

        console.log( 'hello:', world, 'üåèüêôüêºüëΩüê≤üåç' );

        // should log: hello: world üåèüêôüêºüëΩüê≤üåç

    }, 0 );

    /*
        Using the stateKeyMapper and
        using the REDUXX_SPECIAL_KEY,
        you can work with regular ReduxX type keys
        OR obscured state keys.
        See the "Obscure Your State Keys" section above
        for more information about that topic.
    */

    const {

        stateKeyMapper,
        REDUXX_SPECIAL_KEY

    } = reduxX;

    // setting the state:
    // this will produce the same state change as in Step 3

    const newState = {};

    newState[

        stateKeyMapper.monkey.favoriteFood[ REDUXX_SPECIAL_KEY ]

    ] = 'apple';

    newState[

        stateKeyMapper.hippo.status.mood[ REDUXX_SPECIAL_KEY ]

    ] = 'full';

    globalStateStorageInstance.setState( newState );

    // getting the state:
    // once again its the same as getting the state like in Step 3

    const monkeyHeight = (

        globalStateStorageInstance.state[

            stateKeyMapper.monkey.height[ REDUXX_SPECIAL_KEY ]
        ]
    );

    console.log(

        `The reduxX monkey is ${ monkeyHeight } tall!`
    );

    // should log: The reduxX monkey is 69cm tall!
}


module.exports = class SomeDiv extends React.Component {

    render() {

        return <div onClick={this.handleClick} />;
    }
}
```
